# Movie Timeline

## First Part
 - The first part of this tool is an API call to a Wikipedia page that will return the top 10 highest-grossing films of a certain year. 
 - This will be necessary for creating a timeline of the hit movies for that given year. 
 - We will then use this list of ten movies and make a call to OMDB for each movie to get the data for each one.
